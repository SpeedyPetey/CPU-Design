# CPU_Design
A simple reduced instruction set computer using Verilog on ModelSim and Quartus, this includes everything from data-paths to finite-state-machines to decoders. It is capable of handling ALU operations such as, memory loading, branch calls, and function execution. Through this project I have been able to understand how CPUs work and the knowledge I learned from here is invaluable. I haven't included the quartus project files or the output of those files, but to do so include all these files and set lab7_top as the top file and the compile.
