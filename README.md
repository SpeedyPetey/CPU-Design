# CPU_Design
A simple reduced instruction set computer using Verilog on ModelSim and Quartus, this includes everything from data-paths to finite-state-machines to decoders. It is capable of handling ALU operations such as, memory loading, branch calls, and function execution. Through this project I have been able to understand how CPUs work and the knowledge I learned from here is invaluable. 

The quartus project files or the output of those files are not included however here are the steps to replicate this project:
1. Download and install Quartus
2. Include all these files in a new Quartus project
3. Set lab7_top as the top file and then compile.
4. See it in action as you download it to your DE1-SOC
